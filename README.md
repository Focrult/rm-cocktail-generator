## The-Creepy-Morty

# Project Description
### What is this project?
This is a collaborative project where our group is tasked to create an application that solves a real-world problem! Using our knowledge gained from the past six modules we have developed a real-world front-end application that can be showcased to potential employers. This application takes full advantage of two server-side APIs, based around Rick & Morty, as well as cocktails! A user will be presented a page titled "The Creepy Morty", as well as a "Start Quiz" button. A modal will be displayed to provide the user a set of instructions. Afterwhich the user will need to go through a series of cocktail ingredients, and after completion, a card of a cocktail as well as a Rick & Morty character are displayed! Each with a unique description and/or details. 

### Files modified
Throughout this project our team has heavily worked on a variety of files. Including;
- Two HTML files being the index.html and the 404.html.
- Two CSS files being the index.css and 404.css.
- Two JavaScript files titled script.js and 404.js

In addition, several images and a video were utilised to create the appropriate atmosphere for the webpage. 

### Challenges
Correct Styling - We went through several design changes.
Ingredient options - Shift from static options to dynamic options due to limited results and poor successful combinations.
Merge conflicts - First time having to deal with merge conflicts, sometimes leading to unexpected main branch issues.
