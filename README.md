## The-Creepy-Morty

# Project Description
### What is this project?
This is a collaborative project where our group is tasked to create an application that solves a real-world problem! Using our knowledge gained from the past six modules we have developed a real-world front-end application that can be showcased to potential employers. This application takes full advantage of two server-side APIs, based around Rick & Morty, as well as cocktails! A user will be presented a page titled "The Creepy Morty", as well as a "Start Quiz" button. A modal will be displayed to provide the user a set of instructions. Afterwhich the user will need to go through a series of cocktail ingredients, and after completion, a card of a cocktail as well as a Rick & Morty character are displayed! Each with a unique description and/or details. 

### Files modified
Throughout this project our team has heavily worked on a variety of files. Including;
- Two HTML files being the index.html and the 404.html.
- Two CSS files being the index.css and 404.css.
- Two JavaScript files titled script.js and 404.js.
- Output.css was modified to prevent its changes to damage our application. 
- Addtional files included are associated with the Tailwind CSS framework.

Furthermore, several images and a video were utilised to create the appropriate atmosphere for the webpage. 

### Challenges
Our team endured a few challenges throughout our coding journeys. Firstly choosing a final style/design for the web application was a time consuming task. We went over three major design changes until we unanimously agreed on a final version. Next was the issue with the ingredient options. Our team shifted from static cocktail button options to a more dynamic version. This was due to the application producing limited results, repeatability of button choices and poor successful combinations. This was resolved from an iterative process of identifying bugs, programming solutions through the agile development process. Lastly merge conflicts were evident, leading to unexpected main branch issues when merged incorrectly. However, after maintaining consistent communication between team members, we managed to prevent this issue persisting. 

Additionally due to time constraints and last minute decisions, we could not fully incorporate Tailwind CSS into the entire application.
